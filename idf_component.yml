version: "0.1.0"

# Declare external component dependencies so that ESP‑IDF can fetch
# them automatically when running `idf.py add-dependency` or when
# building the project.  These versions should be compatible with
# ESP‑IDF v6.x and LVGL v8.x.

dependencies:
  # Note: The JD9165 panel driver and GT911 touch driver are part of
  # ESP‑IDF's built‑in esp_lcd component starting from v5.3.  To avoid
  # external component resolution issues on some platforms, we only
  # list LVGL here.  The custom GT911 driver is provided locally in
  # this project under components/esp_lcd_touch_gt911.
  #
  # LVGL graphics library.  Version 9.4.0 is the latest stable
  # release at the time of writing【740980510896923†L509-L514】
